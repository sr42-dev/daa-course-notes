general :

- swapping elements in place taking one element at a time
- comparison is done only with the very next element
- swaps are done if the next element is smaller than the one being evaluated
- when the next element is larger, pointer is reset to first element and loop is repeated

- each iteration in an array of n elements does n-i comparisons (nested loop)
- aka sink sort
- basic operation : comparison

- for i <- 0 to n-2
	
	for j <- 0 to n-2-i

		if a[j+1] < a[j]

			swap a[j] and a[j+1]

- can be made more efficient by setting flag before each for loop

	- flag is set to 1 when swap doesn't occur
	- therefore the loop can be skipped from that point as when a swap doesn't occur, it means the element has reached it's final position
