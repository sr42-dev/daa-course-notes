general :

- directly based on inputs for the problem statement
- try every single input to get the necessary output

- divisors of natural number n : to check every number from 1 to n
- 8 queens puzzle : examine each positioning possible on the board and check if an attack is possible
- linear search

- selection sort : 
	
	- swap the next smallest element with the first, same with the second and so on
	- loop repeats until no smaller element is present to the right

	- for i to n-2

		min <- i
		
		for j = i+1 to n-1

			if a[j] < a[min]

				min <- j

			swap a[i] & a[min]

	- not stable as a swap is made at every iteration

- stable sorting : when the order of identical elements is maintained

- sequential search :

	- i <- 0

	  while i < n and a[i] != key
	
		i <- i + 1

	  in i < n return i
	  else return -1

	-
