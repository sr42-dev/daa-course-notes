general :

- tower of hanoi is an exponentially time complex problem
- travelling salesman problem : O(n!), np complete
- a problem is NP-complete when: it is a problem for which the correctness of each solution can be verified quickly and a brute-force search algorithm can actually find a solution by trying all possible solutions

-  steps for analysis :
	
	- understand the problem
	- decide on computational means
	- decide on exact v/s appx solution
	- data structures e.g.; dijkstra's algorithm
	- algorithm design technique
	- design algorithm
	- prove correctness : finite time/within a margin of error
	- analyze : efficient, simple & general
	- code
