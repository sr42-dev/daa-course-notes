steps to analysis :

- decide on parameter n indicating input size
- identify basic operation
- if basic operation execution count depends on input size, find worst, avg & best case efficiency, else normal efficiency
- set up recurrence relation
- solve recurrence & estimate order of magnitude of the solution
