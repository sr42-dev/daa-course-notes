sorting :

- helps searching
- algorithms often use sorting as a subroutine
- e.g.; selection, bubble, insertion, merge, heap
- evaluated based on number of key comparisons
- stability : accuracy
- in place : excess memory unnecessary

searching

string processing

graph processing :

- shortest path
- minimum cost topologies

geometry :

- closest pair
- convex hull

time complexity calculation :

- step count method :
	
	- count the number of steps (by global variable usually)	
	- express it as a function of input size

space complexity :
	
	- sum of fixed path & variable path
	- instruction/input space is constant
