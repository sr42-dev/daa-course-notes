introduction :

- algorithms : defined procedures/rules to solve a partiular problem
- non ambiguous
- finite amount of time
- range of inputs formalized
- formalizing algorithms help deepen understanding

problems :

- old world problem : man, cabbage, goat, wolf
- new world problem : 4 people, 1 flashlight
- 12 marbles, 1 odd (heavy/light) : find odd one out in 3 balancings
- given an A4 paper, make a hole big enough for a human
