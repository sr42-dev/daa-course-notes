steps to analysis :

- find the input size i.e.; the (fewest number of) singular value(s) that can be used to describe the size of the input
- find the most basic operation that consumes time e.g.; contained in the innermost loop
- find the number of iterations for any given input
- express the total time taken for execution wrt input size

- find best, worst & average case efficiency (if equal, find general time efficiency)
- consequently, you get time complexity by simplifying using standard formulae
